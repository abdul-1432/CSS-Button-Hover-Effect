```css
/* Example styles */
.hover-button {
  background-color: #3498db;
  color: #ffffff;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  font-size: 16px;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

.hover-button:hover {
  background-color: #2980b9;
}
```

Feel free to experiment with colors, padding, font sizes, and other properties to achieve the desired look for your buttons.
